# 2XKO Combo Maker

This project was sparked after seeing [this
thread](https://x.com/play2xko/status/1787633824752455959?s=61) on Twitter.

Essentially the 2KXO team shared a combo and many people expressed
dissatisfaction with the notation used.

```plaintext
d.H > uf > j.L > j.M > j.H > j.S1 > L > M > H > df.H > uf > j.M > j.H > j.S2 > darius b.T > T (handshake tag to darius) > d.H  > d.S1 > T (handshake tag to illaoi) > dash > uf > j.d.[H] > ddS1
```

This project is an attempt to create a UI where combos can be created and then
shared as an image or using of the many available formats.
